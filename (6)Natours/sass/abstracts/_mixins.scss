MEDIA QUERY MANAGER

With the help of 'content' Directive, we can pass in an entire block of code, into the mixin.
We can write individual mixins for all the Breakpoints, or we can write 1 large mixin for all our Breakpoints.
rems do not work in some browsers as intended. There are some experiments that have been conducted, and it is
concluded that ems is the best choice for Media Queries. The conversion is '1em = 16px', and so we are 
converting 600px, 900px, 1200px and 1800px into ems.

0 - 600px:          Phone
600 - 900px:        Tablet Portrait
900 - 1200px:       Tablet Landscape
[1200 - 1800px]:    Normal CSS Styles
1800px + :          Big Desktop

$breakpoint Argument Choices
- phone
- tab-port
- tab-land
- big-desktop

ORDER: Base + Typography > General Layout + Grid > Page Layout > Components
